# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Analysis

This project performs customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on retail data. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, RFM analysis is performed to segment customers into three clusters based on their loyalty and spending behavior. The project also includes visualizations to understand sales trends, top-selling products and categories, and a histogram of total sales. Finally, the project defines targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment and visualizes the results using a scatter plot. This project can be used as a template for customer segmentation and targeted marketing in other retail or e-commerce businesses.
